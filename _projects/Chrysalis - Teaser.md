    Teaser for the release of Chrysalis

Between the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022 I had the possibility to work with sound designer and composer Riccardo Bazzoni to create the visual exeperience surround the entire composition. Here's the official teaser anticipating the public release of **[Chrysalis](https://chrysalisband.bandcamp.com/)**.
