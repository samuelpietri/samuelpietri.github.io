And now, the final act of life, the ultimate ripple. Death as its fulfillment.

We are mortal from the very first moment of life. Finiteness, from which there is no escape, can be both a stimulus and an inevitable promise for the living.

But even as everything perishes, nothing and no one, not even the end itself, can ever take away the time we have reached.

Yet something settles forever. And when the path is interrupted, we slip out of our own bodies, we dissolve, evaporate, blending into a shadow. Then a final icy kiss takes us away. And even the wind, weary, falls.


Perhaps, as Zarathustra urged us, we should only 'die at the right moment.' Because death awakens us to life.
