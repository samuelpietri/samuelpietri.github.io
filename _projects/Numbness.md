Numbness is an audiovisual installation that explores transformation, alienation, and the dissolution of the familiar. Through a dynamic interplay of imagery and sound, the work presents a forest that slowly mutates under the influence of foreign forces. What begins as a natural, calm environment is progressively altered—its shapes, textures, and rhythms shifting as external energies infiltrate. The organic and the unknown merge, creating an eerie, liminal space where reality becomes uncertain.

Layered with dissonant soundscapes and fragmented voices, Numbness evokes a sense of detachment and estrangement. The installation captures the threshold between presence and absence, stability and rupture. As the forest succumbs to transformation, the piece reflects on the fragility of perception and the inevitability of change—questioning whether this metamorphosis is an invasion, an evolution, or an unraveling.
