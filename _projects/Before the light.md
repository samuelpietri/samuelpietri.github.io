Before the Light is an audiovisual exploration of an original, enigmatic moment—the birth of life itself. Inspired by the homonymous audio track, the piece embodies the raw, untamed force that breaks through darkness, shaping existence in an overwhelming initiatory surge. A dynamic interplay of shifting textures and light unfolds, illustrating the chaotic yet inevitable journey toward illumination.

At the core of the work lies an experimental generative system driven by artificial neural networks (GANs). By training models on altimetric images of the Earth's surface—rich in fractal structures and multi-scale detail—I developed a continuously evolving stream of visual textures. These generative forms, shaped and guided by the soundscape, create a fluid, ever-transforming experience. The final installation captures a single crystallized instance of this infinite process, suspending the viewer in the fragile moment before emergence.
