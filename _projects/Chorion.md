   Chorion - Chrysalis Album
</div>
Chorion is an audiovisual exploration of transformation and resilience, inspired by the delicate yet protective structure of butterfly eggs. Just as the chorion safeguards the larval development within, this piece resonates with the chrysalis in its metamorphic stateâ€”an enclosed space of fluid change, tension, and imminent evolution.

At the core of Chorion is a generative visual system driven by GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), trained on images of moving and crashing water. This ever-shifting visual flux forms textured landscapes that evolve in real-time, shaped and sculpted by sound. The resulting imagery is both organic and abstract, evoking the microscopic yet monumental forces at play within the fragile shell of new life. By fusing generative image synthesis with reactive sound design, Chorion seeks to push the boundaries of audiovisual expression, immersing the viewer in a world where transformation is both a process and an experience.
