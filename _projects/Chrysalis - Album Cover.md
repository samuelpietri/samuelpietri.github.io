For the creation of **[Chrysalis'](https://chrysalisband.bandcamp.com/)** artwork I focused on the theme of transformation. My initial intent was to trap a flow in an instant. The slow build-up of energy to accommodate change or movement that is interrupted, like a spark. The latest iteration of the research undertaken involves the use of a generative model that uses photographic material, images of butterfly wings, as a source of learning, a mnemonic archive through which to create new forms mediated by cuts, cracks, artefacts, imperfections that the algorithm collects and transforms. The information that the artificial neural network manages to incorporate is sometimes diverted, controlled, at other times left free to explore.
