Memories are fleeting, elusive, and often unpredictable. They are the building blocks of our identity, shaping who we are and how we see the world. But memories can also be distorted, fragmented, and even lost altogether.



In this audiovisual artwork, we explore the complexity of memory and its role in shaping our identity and understanding of the world through the metaphor of a human life. From the first images imprinted on our eyes to the incessant flow of information we receive every day to moments when the noise becomes too loud and forgetting seems like the only thing left to do.


A series of fragments, clues, and associations challenge our assumptions and expectations reflecting the constant evolution of our memories and ourselves.

Transience  invites the viewer to reflect on their own experiences of growing up and the memories that have shaped their lives. It encourages us to think about the ways in which our memories can both enrich and deceive us, and to consider how we can deal with our mind to better understand our own identity.
