This audiovisual artwork, created with sound designer Riccardo Bazzoni, explores the complexity of memory and its role in shaping our identity and understanding of the world through the metaphor of a human life. From the first images imprinted on our eyes to the incessant flow of information we receive every day to moments when the noise becomes too loud and forgetting seems like the only thing left to do.

A series of fragments, clues, and associations challenge our assumptions and expectations reflecting the constant evolution of our memories and ourselves.
Transience invites the viewer to reflect on their own experiences of growing up and the memories that have shaped their lives. It encourages us to think about the ways in which our memories can both enrich and deceive us, and to consider how we can deal with our mind to better understand our own identity.

This project was a deep dive exploration of diffusion-based generative models for the creation of a cinematic experience that could push the limits of ordinary animation techniques.
