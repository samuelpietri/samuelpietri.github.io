Before the light is the first track of the album Chrysalis and it's mainly connected to the idea of representing what comes just before the spark of light. I went on researching different ways to visualize this metaphor in a powerful yet abstract way. After different prototypes I decided to simulate dynamic cracks formations and fessure on surfaces che lasciassero trapelare, disvelare un bagliore forte e incessante.
