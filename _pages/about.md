I'm a Creative Technologist with a multidisciplinary approach. My interest is strongly connected the development of projects with a strong innovative component in the field of emerging technologies with a focus on interactive and generative elements that can have a positive impact on people.
I graduated in Architecture and Building Engineering at the University of Bologna in 2016 where I developed his interest toward computational design and algorithm design for design purposes. My master thesis untitled “Fibrous Aerial Robotics” focuses on the study of spiderweb strategies for the design of architectural envelopes using swarms of drones and inflatable formworks.
I joined fuse* in 2017 as a Creative Technologist where I continued his research revolves around the study and exploration of generative models for the realization of simulation systems inspired by natural processes.I combine an architectural background with computer skills in the field of creative coding.
Over time I conducted different projects centered on agent-based simulations, procedural algorithms and real-time graphics. His current research focuses on the exploration of generative models for biomimetic simulation systems, real-time graphics development and the integration of machine learning models for the development of interactive applications.
