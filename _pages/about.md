I am a visual artist and creative technologist with a multidisciplinary approach, specializing in projects that blend emerging technologies with interactive and generative elements. My work is driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to creating experiences that engage and inspire.

I hold a Master's degree in Architecture and Building Engineering from the University of Bologna, where I developed a deep interest in computational and algorithmic design. My masterâ€™s thesis, Fibrous Aerial Robotics, explored the use of spiderweb-inspired strategies to design architectural envelopes through swarms of drones and inflatable formworks.

As a Creative Technologist at fuse* design studio, I have contributed to cutting-edge installations and performances worldwide. My research focuses on generative models, natural process simulations, and the intersections of computational design and creative coding. My work spans agent-based simulations, procedural algorithms, and real-time graphics, with a current emphasis on biomimetic systems, real-time rendering, and integrating machine learning into interactive applications.

Lately, I have been exploring the limits of human visual perception, challenging sensory boundaries to uncover unexpected experiences. Through my practice, I seek to reveal the intricate relationship between perception and reality, expanding how we interpret the world around us.
