I'm a visual artist and creative technologist with a multidisciplinary approach, specializing in projects that blend emerging technologies with interactive and generative elements. His work is driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to creating experiences that positively impact people.

I hold a Master's degree in Architecture and Building Engineering from the University of Bologna, where he developed a deep interest in computational and algorithmic design. His master’s thesis, titled “Fibrous Aerial Robotics,” explored the use of spiderweb strategies to design architectural envelopes using swarms of drones and inflatable formworks.

As a Creative Technologist at fuse* design studio, I've contributed to shaping cutting-edge installations and performances worldwide. His research has since focused on generative models, simulating natural processes, and exploring the intersections of computational design and creative coding.

My work includes projects centered on agent-based simulations, procedural algorithms, and real-time graphics. Currently, his research delves into biomimetic simulation systems, real-time graphics development, and integrating machine learning models to create interactive applications.

In his latest explorations, I investigate the limits of human visual perception. By challenging the boundaries of sensory experience, he seeks to reveal unexpected experiences and explore the intricate relationship between visual perception and the interpretation of reality
